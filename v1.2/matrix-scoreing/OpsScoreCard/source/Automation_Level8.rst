======================
Automation - (Level 8)
======================

* Is the system able to deploy new versions of software in a continuous rolling upgrade manner?
* Are root causes fixed in the application and deployed immediately?
* Are all software defects corrected by the development team? (Meaning, operations is not expected to put in temporary or work-around types of fixes)
* Are additional nodes auto-created due to any failures or capacity shortfalls?
