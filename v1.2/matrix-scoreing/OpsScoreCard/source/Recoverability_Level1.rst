Recoverability - (Level 1)
==========================

* Does the system have any method or manner of recoverability? 
* In the event of a system outage, is all data retained? (zero data lost)
* Is there a development team assigned to the product or system?
* Is the location of the application / system source code known?
* Is the code located in a version control system?
* Does the code for version "x" in the version control system match the code in production for the same version?
