======================
Automation - (Level 1)
======================

* Are deployments using automation? (no manual deploys)
* Does the application or system have any type of configuration management in place?
* Deployments do not require a human to run commands manually at the command line on each host?
* Has cluster-SSH been eliminated as your automation and configuration management system of choice?
