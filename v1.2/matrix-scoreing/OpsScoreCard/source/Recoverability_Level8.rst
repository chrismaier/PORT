Recoverability - (Level 8)
==========================

* Is the system geo-redundant?
* Has cross datacenter fail-over been implemented and tested with a successful outcome?
* Does the system automatically detect failures and route customer traffic to an alternate datacenter?
* Is the customer unaware of any failures and rerouting of their traffic to an alternate location?
* Is there zero downtime if any type of disaster event or system failure occurs?
* Can the system survive a ChaosMonkey or ChaosGorilla outage without human intervention?
* Is the infrastructure able to respond to failed components and automatically recreate the missing elements?
* Is the infrastructure able to respond to load thresholds and automatically add new capacity / auto-scale?
