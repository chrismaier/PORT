Spirit / Intent:

* Passwords for the systems and service accounts and the like should be stored in a central authentication system.
* Access for Rackers should be via SSO or other centralized password system.
* When a Racker terminates their employment, their system access is immediately terminated.


Justification:

* This is a common compliance requirement.
* This is a system best practices.
* Rackspace customers expect this.


Success Criteria:

* Test the termination of an example account and verify that access is removed.
