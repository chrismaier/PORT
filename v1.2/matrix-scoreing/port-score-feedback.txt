Specific feedback on the survey questions themselves:


Plain text password “storage” question - make sure its clear that the password should not be plain text on the system itself vs. not in plain text anywhere on the planet.


“Recoverability”
Data loss - be specific as to what data loss looks like and what data we are referring to


“Standards”
Look at the wording related to open source and COTS software - see if there needs to be clarification, make sure we aren’t penalizing simply because proprietary software is being used.
