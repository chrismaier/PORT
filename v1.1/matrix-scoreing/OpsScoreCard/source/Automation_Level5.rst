======================
Automation - (Level 5)
======================

* Does the system implement something resembling a "One Click Deploy"?
* The addition of all new nodes is scripted or automated in a manner that requires running a single command?
* Does configuration management run automatically and in a continuous manner?
* Is continuous system state verification in place?
* Are any system state discrepancies automatically corrected without human intervention?
* Is there a defined bug-fix and patch process to correct defects outside of the normal release or sprint?
* When a new node is added to the system, is the new node automatically added to the monitoring system?
