Automation - (Level 2)
======================

* Does the system have a runbook or wiki and a build script?
* Has the system eliminated the need to use bash or other scripts copied manually to individual nodes?
* Has the system eliminated the need to run a deployment or configuration tool manually via SSH or the like on individual nodes?
* Do alerts get fired if a systems configuration or code is modified outside of a release?
* Does the system have any checks, verifications, or notifications that identify if system drift has occurred?
* Are all system deployment and configuration changes kept in a version control system?
