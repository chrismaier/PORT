==========================
Recoverability - (Level 5)
==========================

* Does the system implement and make use of hot spares?
* Is there minimal customer impact if an incident happens?
* Does the system implement multi-master cross data center replication of all system and user data?
* Is the process for recreating a failed environment automated?
* Is the time to recover from a disaster or complete environment loss less than 48 hours? (once hardware is received)
* Has a disaster recovery test been performed with a successful result?
* Is there a quality engineering test that simulates failures of random system components?
