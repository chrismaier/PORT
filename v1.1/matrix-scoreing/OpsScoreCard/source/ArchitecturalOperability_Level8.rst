=====================================
Architectural Operability - (Level 8)
=====================================

* Does the system automatically detect errors and issues and correct these without human intervention? (Self healing)
* Can all deployments be done with zero customer impact?
* Will the loss of a single datacenter cause a service interruption?
* Is the data for the application replicated to multiple data centers in real-time?
* Is the application able to perform a cross data center failover automatically and with zero customer down time?
* Has all administrator access to all systems been removed?
* Are all system activities done off-box and in a manner that doesn't require a human to log in?
* Are all unauthorized system changes automatically detected and result in the modified node being removed from rotation?
