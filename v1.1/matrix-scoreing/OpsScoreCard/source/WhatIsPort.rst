What is PORT?
=============


Proactive Operational Reliability Team (PORT)


The Proactive Operational Reliability Team (PORT) was formed in July 2013 to help bring stability, reliability, and scalability to our ever-growing Rackspace Cloud. The team is currently focusing on three main efforts:


#. Identifying and documenting all products, systems, and their interactions and dependencies on each other, and identifying systems most likely to have an incident so we can proactively take action to stabilize them now. 


#. Communicating with Support, Product, Product Leadership, and SLT about recent major incidents while ensuring their full resolution measures are completed and integrated into QE.


#. Defining long-term best practices for all products and systems in order to increase stability, reliability, and scalability and ensure that monitoring, alerting, incident management, root cause analysis, long term remediation, and QE improvements become seamless and natural parts of the Rackspace development and deployment processes.


It is important to note that all PORT definitions should be generic enough to apply to ALL systems and applications.  There should not be any tests or port requirements that are specific to any product or system.
